<h2 class="pb-4">A fresh start</h2>
<div class="pt-3">
  <p>
    You may have noticed that we've changed the furniture and the wallpapers
    around here...
  </p>
  <p class="pb-4">
    Murrtube just got a massive make-over for a bunch of reasons that are
    explained here, with stuff gone, stuff introduced... And all that with one
    goal in mind:
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong
      >To make your lil' Murrtube sessions a smoother and better experience
      :3</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p class="pb-4">
    We are looking into doing another one to go more into the tech details of
    what happened here too!
    <br />
    But for now, our beloved tail-waggers, we present to you :
    <strong>Murrtube 2.0</strong>
  </p>
</div>
<h2 class="py-4">New Logo!</h2>

  <p>
    This little fox ball of mischief will be the new visual identity for
    Murrtube.
  </p>
  <p>
    We definitely like this cute fluffy thing a lot more than our old generic
    wolf silouhette thing :3

<h2 class="py-4">Goodbye superfluous features!</h2>
<div class="columns is-multiline">
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Exit dark/light theme</h4>
    <p>
      It's just gonna stay dark. AD literally has 'dark' in it. Nah but also I'm
      not good at designing stuff and this was an easy shortcut. Also goes with
      'simplification of everything simplifiable' effort.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">No more profile banners</h4>
    <p>
      Uncluttering! We know, banners were great to plaster naked bodies on your
      profile, but we thought it'd be better to give more space to videos.
      That's where the actual juicy stuff is.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Likes/Followers listings begone</h4>
    <p>
      It was a customizable setting before, now the default is: not your
      profile? can't see the list of followers or liked videos. Not your video?
      You can't see who liked it. Just the numbers. Some discretion is nice in
      porn!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Bbye comment replies</h4>
    <p>
      Same thing, simplify stuff, unclutter interface, etc, etc… Comments
      themselves are not used a lot but we still think they're important, but
      replies is a little overdoing it.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">In app chat messaging is gone</h4>
    <p>
      We realized that it really isn't used much, and users would usually go
      straight to user's twitter page (listed on their profile) to DM them.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="py-4">Enter: The new stuff!</h2>

<div class="columns is-multiline">
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Global search, super buffed</h4>
    <p>
      The global search used to do its own thing sometimes and it was never 100%
      clear what that thing was. So it's been reworked a bit, just to make it
      more efficient and reliable.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Tags can make sense, if we code 'em right</h4>
    <p>
      Tags up until now were a MESS. For real. The tagging system has been
      revamped so that matching can work reliably, and to avoid typos and stuff
      like that.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Hey Twitter, check out our video quality</h4>
    <p>
      Until a few months ago, your videos were reprocessed to a pretty
      disappointing quality, because it saved time and bandwidth and money. We
      then upped it a bit so it'd be at least better than Twitter. But you know
      what, we like to see all the pixels clearly when we're watching a shiny
      latex pup annihilate a fursuit, so we've boosted up the size and bitrate
      of our encoder even MORE.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Bad people shoooo</h4>
    <p>
      The report and banning systems until now worked, but like, at their bare
      minimum: You report someone, you never get the update that the action has
      been taken. We changed that. It's nice to know you've been helpful. Also
      bans have been revamped to be less 'whatever' or 'banned for 500 years'.
      Hopefully you'll never have to find out!
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Impatient uploaders, we got you</h4>
    <p>
      You filmed and edited all this porn, and now it's uploaded. And now, the
      wait begins. When the hell will this lazy cat review my video? Hey, what
      about subscribing to live updates on Telegram? Our bot will ping you
      through the lifecycle of your video! Pretty sweet right? Poke our bot,
      he'll let you in on the trick.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Ad space</h4>
    <p>
      WAIT WAIT WAIT. Hear me out, I know, nobody likes ads. But Murrtube is a
      needy boy and it needs its lunch money. So, ad space has been added, in
      the least intrusive way possible. It won't be all over the place. On top
      of that, ad campaigns will be very carefully selected. Only stuff that a
      mob of horny degenerates would be interested in.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">Europe rules</h4>
    <p>
      We made triple sure that we're on par with everything required by European
      regulations regarding data privacy and protection. We are hosted in France
      after all, so y’all get to enjoy some of that fancy European ‘People’s
      privacy matters’ sauce. Hey now! don't worry all your stuff was safe and
      GDPR compliant before! We've just added reliable procedures to comply with
      rules that usually should only apply to big corporations.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half is-full-touch">
    <h4 class="pt-4">This whole separate website</h4>
    <p>
      This secondary website was added to keep the main app as lean as possible.
      But of course we still needed a place for the legal stuff, and for you to
      reach out for comments or help! So we added this About site, and this news
      blog as well!
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="py-4">"But why?", said Ryan Reynolds</h2>

<h4 class="pt-4">Cuz.</h4>
<p>
  Murrtube is 4 and a half years old. Technology moves at a pace. Murrtube
  didn't. To a point that, well… I didn't wanna touch Murrtube's codebase even
  with a 1 mile pole. Which means barely any maintenance, any fixes, any
  improvements. It's nice to start fresh on something that doesn't make me irate
  when I look at it.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the stuff listed before are features and improvements I've wanted to
  do for a while, now here they are :3
</p>

<h4 class="pt-4">And fun.</h4>
<p class="pb-4">
  Besides, it's hella fun to run a porn website, and to make it as close as
  possible to what you AD folks could want! Doing this just brings back the fun
  for me, and hopefully for all of you too!
</p>

<h2 class="py-4">Yes we cum</h2>
<p>
  All in all, I really hope that this new Murrtube will be good enough for all
  of you :3
  <br />
  I plan to dedicate more time to it, and your continued support for all these
  years is my main fuel, so together let's keep making Murrtube a great space
  for our kinksters and kinkster-afficionados
</p>
<br />
<p>
  FEED ME PORN. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. SLOPPY RAW GOOEY PORN. JUST. FEED.
  <br />
  I want murrsuits, partials, pups, latex, neoprene, leather, petsuits, all
  kinds of tools, whatever, good ol' kinky stuff.
</p>
<br />
<p class="pb-4">
  And I will see you at our next update, or at our next stats compilation :3
  Love y'all!
</p>
